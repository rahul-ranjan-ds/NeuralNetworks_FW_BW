# Neural Networks Model 
Create a L Layered Neural Network to classify handwritten digits between 0-9. 

It is divided into the following sections:
1. Data preparation
2. Feedforward
3. Loss computation
4. Backpropagation
5. Parameter updates
6. Model training and predictions

# Data
28x28 greyscale images in the MNIST dataset.
